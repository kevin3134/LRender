## Matrix transfer and coordinates
object coordinates  
|| model  
world coordinates  
|| view  
eye coordinates  
|| projection  
clip coordinates (-1,1; still 3d coordinate, but we could assume front is the 2d image)  
|| viewport  
screen coordinates  

## About GLM
View matrix, projection matrix used in this project are mainly from GLM.  
However, GLM matrix is different from matrix we commonly used, it is transposed.

## 关于GLM
视图矩阵和投影矩阵来自GLM库，但是GLM库中的矩阵是和我们认知矩阵转置的
